### Example Encoded Archival Description (EAD) Documents and MARC Records

Within this repository, members of the Metadata Standards Sub-Team shall track
examples of [EAD Documents](https://www.loc.gov/ead/) and [MARCXML records](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) which shall be used for testing importation and the 
extraction of metadata within ArchivesSpace.

This repository is structured with two directories at the root path, one for the
EADs, and one for the MARC record examples. Within each of these, each contain a
 collection of Documents or records from a participating institution or 
 organization.
